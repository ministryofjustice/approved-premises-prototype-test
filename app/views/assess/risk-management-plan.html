                When developing contingency plans consider what role increased supervision, additional monitoring/control or greater intervention might play when a trigger is detected. Additionally consider whether following the trigger greater protection is needed for those named individuals or groups at risk.

                Referral to  MAPPA level 2 to be considered in this case should any additional complexities emerge.

                If in community and suspicion of alcohol use enforcement action to be taken, recall to be considered in the first instance.

                If Mr Brown forms friendships with previous or new alcohol and drug using peers, this is to be discussed with Mr Brown as to short and long term consequences for him.
